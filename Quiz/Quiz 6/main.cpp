/*
EXPLENATION
I decided to use the algorithm library to sort the numbers. It was much cleaner and less work. 
1 : I created the three files and a test file. the test file helped in making sure my 
program ran correctly before I populated the other 3 files. Itâ€™s easier to find mistakes when there is only one .cpp to work with.
2 : In the .hpp file I created the class and assigned all the functions to public so I could use them throughout the program.
The items in private I did not want to accidentally change them in the program.
3 : In the IntegerArray.cpp is where I created the functions. In the sortArray function I was trying to use the while loop and my program got stuck in an infinite loop.
I switched to if statements and it worked very well. */
